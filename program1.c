/*
WAP for the below given scenario:
A university wants to automate their admission process. Students are admitted based on the marks scored in a qualifying exam.
A student is identified by student id, age and marks in qualifying exam. Data are valid, if:
●	Age is greater than 20
●	Marks is between 0 and 100 (both inclusive)
A student qualifies for admission, if
●	Age and marks are valid and
●	Marks is 65 or more
Write a program to represent the students seeking admission in the university.
